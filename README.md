# Pebble-TocV2
---

This is the SDK 2.0 version of my other watchface CupricWolf/pebble-toc.
Thanks to phardy for providing the code with phardy/Trails.

This watchface is my attempt to remake the [i-Toc](http://www.i-toc.com/) watch on the pebble.
The watch hands are rotors in the watchface.
The outer ring is the minute hand and the inner circle is the hour hand.
The position of the hands are given by the solid line between black and white.
