# Pebble-Toc V2
---

This is the SDK 2.0 version of my other watchface [CupricWolf/pebble-toc](https://github.com/CupricWolf/pebble-toc).
Thanks to [phardy](https://github.com/phardy) for providing the code with [phardy/Trails.](https://github.com/phardy/Trails)

This watchface is my attempt to remake the [i-Toc](http://www.i-toc.com/) watch on the pebble.
The watch hands are rotors in the watchface.
The outer ring is the minute hand and the inner circle is the hour hand.
The position of the hands are given by the solid line between black and white.
In the examples below the red Pebble is displaying 12:00 and the black Pebble Steel is displaying 10:10.

## Examples:

## Download:
You can download the watchface [here](/Pebble_TocV2.pbw?raw=true) or you can view the raw file in the repository.
